For connecting instance through ssh:
************************************

copy the id_rsa.pub key to (authorized key) file path in which instance you need to connect
run this command after copying the key to the instance --> run the command in jumphost(ssh -i id_rsa -p 2222 root@172.31.48.109)


1.create a ssh-key file in the instance-1 (id_rsa.pub)
2.copy the key to the authorized_keys file path in the instance-2 which you need to connect
3.run the command in instance-1 (ssh -i id_rsa -p 2222 root@172.31.48.109)/(ssh -i /home/ajith/.ssh/id_rsa -p 2222 root@172.31.50.158)


For copying the ssh-key to another instance:
********************************************
ssh-copy-id -i /home/ajith/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -p 2222 username@private-ip





connecting instance through ssh using Password:
***********************************************
1. Enable ssh root login in sshd_config file (vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
2. Then try to login from jumphost to target server using root user


1. edit the config file in root user which you need to connect (vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config) update
2. restart the sshd using systemctl restart sshd.service
3. Then try to login from jumphost to target server using root user
