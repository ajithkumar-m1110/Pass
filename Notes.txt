what is ssh
	Secure Shell(SSH) connecting to server with the local machine with secure network protocol, using port-22 

how to create ssh key
how to connect through ssh key between two instance
ssh port
	Used for communication and allows remote administration acces to the VM



stickey bit --(used on folders/files in order to avoid deletion of a folder even the user has its full permission)
	        --chmod +t (folder/file name) use this command to make the folder/files into stickey



firewall in linux  --- systemctl status firewalld(used to check the firewall status)
		   --- firewall-cmd -->state(used to check the state of firewall)
		   --- firewall-cmd -->list-all(used to get the firewall details in server)
 
scp (--l or scp man)


Shell scripting:
***************
Shell/Sh/bourne Shell --> The command which are typing in the terminal are called shell

Types --> Bash (Default)
	  ash -> lightweight runs in low-memory
	  korn -> use for programming features
	  tcsh -> to attact c programmers
	  zsh -> advanced shell it incorporates features from bash, tcsh, and korn

Bash shell can operate in two modes:
	1. Interactive mode
	(writing commands directly to the shell)

	2.Programming mode
	(writing shell scripts)

Steps to create Shell Scripts:
	nano text.sh (use this command to create a shell scripts)
	chmod +x test.sh (convert the file to executable one)
	./test.sh (to run the shell scripts)






splunk --> used to show the logs

CrowdStrike --> its used to mointer and to upload in server

opsgenie --> altering

uptrends --> monitering

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access):
***********************************
	* Any one can able to access the files or directory in a organization, if he has a LDAP permission.
	* Port No:389
	* Is a software protocol for enabling anyone to locate data about organizations, individuals and other
resources such as files and devices in a network.
	* It helps computer to make into domain members.




Login into Jumphoste:
*********************
ssh -i C:\Users\ajithkumarm\Desktop\ilink\Keys\shantanu-prod-amm-test.pem ajith@54.244.136.49


Connect the instance through Jumphoste:
***************************************
ssh -i keyfilename username@private-ip

Eg --> ssh -i testkey -p 2222 imtadmin@172.31.58.23


To login into Instance:
***********************
ssh -i location/keyfilename username@public-ip


To copy the file to Instance:
*****************************
scp -i keypath sourcefilepath ec2-user@public-ip:desgninationpath

Eg:
***
scp -i C:\Users\ajithkumarm\Downloads\test-01.pem C:\Users\ajithkumarm\Desktop\Tenable\abc\NessusAgent-10.1.4-es7.x86_64.rpm ec2-user@52.70.249.12:/home/ec2-user/Tena


To copy the file to Local:
**************************
scp -i keypath username@ec2ip:sourcefilepath desgninationpath

Eg --> scp -i C:\Users\ajithkumarm\Desktop\ilink\Keys\shantanu-prod-amm-test.pem ajith@54.244.136.49:/home/ajith/.ssh/testkey C:\Users\ajithkumarm\Downloads
              

scp jump:/home/ajith/.ssh/testkey C:\Users\ajithkumarm\Downloads

scp C:\Users\ajithkumarm\Desktop\Ansible\Launch-AMI-and-configure-on-new-instance.yml jump:/home/ajith




For connecting instance through ssh:
************************************

copy the id_rsa.pub key to (authorized key) file path in which instance you need to connect
run this command after copying the key to the instance --> run the command in jumphost(ssh -i id_rsa -p 2222 root@172.31.48.109)


1.create a ssh-key file in the instance-1 (id_rsa.pub)
2.copy the key to the authorized_keys file path in the instance-2 which you need to connect
3.run the command in instance-1 (ssh -i id_rsa -p 2222 root@172.31.48.109)/(ssh -i /home/ajith/.ssh/id_rsa -p 2222 root@172.31.50.158)


For copying the ssh-key to another instance:
********************************************
ssh-copy-id -i /home/ajith/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -p 2222 username@private-ip


connecting instance through ssh using Password:
***********************************************
1. Enable ssh root login in sshd_config file (vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
2. Then try to login from jumhost to target server using root user

AWS:
****
CloudFormation --> it helps to create and manage AWS resources


SSM in AWS --> a server used to configure and manager a collection of Ec2 instance
			   used to see the highlevel details from the centerlized
			   
			   
cidr range in vpc --> stands for Classless Inter-DomainRouting, is an IP addressing scheme that improves the allocation of IP addresses.


network class -->


netmask --> A subnet mask is a 32-bit number created by setting setting network bits to all 1s and host bits to all 0s 
			the subnet mask separates the IP address into network and host addresses.

			
gateway --> to create API(Application Programming Interface), and to secure the rest API, manage and to scale
	Amazon API gateway is an AWS service for creating, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST APIs at any scale.
	

routetable --> to communicate between the subnets



update the contact in aws ldap


Active Directory:
*****************
DNS --> Domain Name Services
NLB --> Network Load Balancer



Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa): key



we are adding our public-ip in instances(through authorized key) and connecting through the private-ip to the instances.
If both get matched only we can able to connect it.




windows+v --> gives the history of copied list



To clear the logs:
******************
