
Ansible --> used to copy a file from jumphost to many instances in a single command
	        it consist of playook and host inventory, modules
	        * playbook-->instruction are noted in the playbook, ansible will read and execute
	        * host Inventory-->used to note the types of server we are used


How Ansible Work:
*****************
	* it will push the modules to the server or instances(there are 450 modules in ansible depends upon the task it will create modules)
	* execute the task in the playbook, once the process completed it will delete the modules
	* it will connect through ssh to each instances


How to setup Ansible in EC2:
****************************
https://thecodecloud.in/ansible-installation-configuration-amazon-linux-ec2-instance-aws/
  Note: from last to 4th command we need to copy the ip from master to client
        run the command in master and put the ip address of the client one



Steps to execute Ansible Playbook:
**********************************
	create a playbook file
	create a hosts file


To start Ansible Playbook:
**************************
	ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook name


To create Roles in Ansible:
***************************
	command--> ansible-galaxy init Filename


To check the Ansible:
*********************
ansible -m ping all (connecting instance through ssh using keys)
ansible -m ping all --ask-pass (connecting instance through ssh using Password)


Notes:
******
ansible-vault decrypt filename
ansible-vault encrypt filename


Ansible Playbook:
*****************
---
- name: abc install & start services
  hosts: all (create the hosts and put your instances ip address)
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: install abc
    yum:
      name: abc
      state: latest

  - name: start abc
    service:
      name: abc
      state: started


Command Used to Execute Playbook:
*********************************
ansible-playbook <ansible-playbook filename>



For connecting instance through ssh:
************************************

copy the id_rsa.pub key to (authorized key) file path in which instance you need to connect
run this command after copying the key to the instance --> run the command in jumphost(ssh -i id_rsa -p 2222 root@172.31.48.109)


1.create a ssh-key file in the instance-1 (id_rsa.pub)
2.copy the key to the authorized_keys file path in the instance-2 which you need to connect
3.run the command in instance-1 (ssh -i id_rsa -p 2222 root@172.31.48.109)/(ssh -i /home/ajith/.ssh/id_rsa -p 2222 root@172.31.50.158)


For copying the ssh-key to another instance:
********************************************
ssh-copy-id -i /home/ajith/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -p 2222 username@private-ip





connecting instance through ssh using Password:
***********************************************
1. Enable ssh root login in sshd_config file (vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
2. Then try to login from jumphost to target server using root user


1. edit the config file in root user which you need to connect (vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config) update
2. restart the sshd using systemctl restart sshd.service
3. Then try to login from jumphost to target server using root user
	ansible -m ping all --ask-pass
