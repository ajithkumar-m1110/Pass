
Github --> Used to store the software in the github server
		   Eg:(used to access the file from multiple places or devices)
	  
	  
commands:
*********

git clone url --> download the repository to local
git add --> add the file in local
git commit -m "msg" --> writing the commant for the changing file(check point)

	short cut for both add & commit:
		git commit -am "msg"
	
git status --> gives the status
git push --> move from local to github
git pull --> get the updated file in github
	merge conflicts --> after running the pull command, if the local & remote file are different its shows the merge conflicts error
		Eg:
			a=1;
			b=2;
			<<<<< HEAD
			c=3; --> local change
			=====
			c=32; --> remote change
			>>>>> 3289fd29d2bc39a --> conflicts commit hash
			
git rest --hard <commit hash> --> to get back to the which commit you need
git branch --> check the branch
git checkout -b "name" --> create new branch
git checkout name --> to switch branch
git merge name --> merge two branch
git push -u origin dev --> to push the branch
