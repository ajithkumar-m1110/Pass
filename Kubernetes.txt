
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management.

It is a container orchestration technology used to orchestrate the deployment and management of hunders and thousands of containers in a clustered environment.

Kubernetes automtes operatinoal tasks of container management and includes built-in commands for deploying applications,
rolling out changes to your applications, scaling your applications up and down to fit changing needs, mointoring your applications,
and more making it easier to manage applications.



Kubernetes has two types nodes
	Master node
	worker node
	
Kubernetes definition file has four sections
	API version(is specific to what we are creating)
	kind(replication controller)
	metadata(lable)
	spec(spec section defines what's inside the object we are creating)
	
***
to create a replication controller:
	kubectl create -f file_name.yml

***
Different between replication controller & replicas:
	Both are working same, Both creates multiple copies of pods
	In replicaset we have to provide selector
	which mean configuration of replicaset and replication controller is differnet
	


applications are run inside the pod(like a container/deployment unit) i.e pod are present inside the worker node
	one applications are allowed to run inside the pod or we can run more but (recommanded is only one)


cluster --> set of nodes grouped together
node(minions -> used in past) --> machine(physicall/virtual) where kubernets is installed, container will launched by kubernets
kubectl --> it deploys a docker container by creating a pod
POD's --> where applications run, pod are present inside the worker node
		  we create a template section under spec to provide a pod template to be used by the replication controller to create replicas
kudeadm --> helps us to setup a multi node cluster with master and workers on seperate machine
replication controller --> helps us to run multiple instances of a single part in the kubernets cluster thus provinding high availability(creates multiple instances of a pod)
						   another reason, we need a replication controller is to create multiple parts to share the load across them



using API Server we are communicating with kubernets
etcd --> to store the deployment data
kubelet --> communicate b/w master & worker node
kube-proxy --> through this user can access the applications


create -f deployment.yml --> to create a deployment file
kubectl get all --> gives the current status
minikube dashboard --> launch dashboard
kubectl describe pod --> gives details inside the pod



Commands:
*********

kubectl run hellow-minikude --> used to deploy a manage applications on a kubernets cluster, to get cluster info, status of other nodes and manage things
kubectl cluster-info --> to view information about the cluster
kubectl get nodes --> to list all nodes part of the cluster
